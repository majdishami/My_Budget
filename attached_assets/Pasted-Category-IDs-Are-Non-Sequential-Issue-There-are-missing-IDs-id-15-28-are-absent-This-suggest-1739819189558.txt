Category IDs Are Non-Sequential
🔴 Issue: There are missing IDs (id: 15-28 are absent). This suggests deleted or unused categories.
✅ Fix: Consider refactoring categories or ensuring IDs remain contiguous.
Duplicate Expenses for Maid Service
🔴 Issue: "Maid Service" appears twice (₹120.00 on 1st and 17th).
✅ Fix: If this is intentional, renaming them (First Payment, Second Payment) improves clarity.
Inconsistent Icons in Categories
🔴 Issue: "icon": null for "Phone Bill", while others have icons.
✅ Fix: Assign a relevant icon (e.g., "phone") for consistency.
Category IDs Not Matching All Expenses
🔴 Issue: "category_id": 29 is assigned to "Phone Bill", but most other categories are under id ≤ 14.
✅ Fix: Consider reordering category IDs or checking for missing category definitions.
🚀 Performance Optimization

Normalize Data Storage
Instead of repeating "user_id": 1 for every bill, a relational database (SQL) could link bills to a user table.
Moving categories to a separate lookup table would reduce redundancy.
Optimize JSON Structure for Faster Parsing
Current Approach:
{
   "bills": [
      { "id": 21, "name": "Rent", "amount": "3750.00", "day": 1, "category_id": 1, "user_id": 1 }
   ]
}
Optimized Approach:

{
   "bills": {
      "21": { "name": "Rent", "amount": "3750.00", "day": 1, "category": "Rent", "user_id": 1 }
   }
}
Using dictionary objects (keys as IDs) instead of lists improves look-up speed.
Convert Amounts to Numeric Data Type
🔴 Issue: "amount": "3750.00" is stored as a string instead of a number.
✅ Fix: "amount": 3750.00 to improve calculations & reduce parsing overhead.
🏗 Structure & Schema Improvement

Proposed JSON Schema
To enhance the structure, a schema like this can improve validation:

{
   "users": [
      { "id": 1, "username": "default_user", "password_hash": "hashed_value" }
   ],
   "categories": {
      "Rent": { "id": 1, "color": "#3B82F6", "icon": "home" },
      "Groceries": { "id": 2, "color": "#10B981", "icon": "shopping-cart" }
   },
   "bills": {
      "21": { "name": "Rent", "amount": 3750.00, "day": 1, "category": "Rent", "user_id": 1 }
   }
}
🔹 Why This is Better?

Faster lookups using key-based dictionaries
Reduced redundant category_id references
