- **Stack Trace**: Ensure that the stack trace is captured and logged to provide more context about where the error originated.
- **Error Handling**: Review the `AnnualReportDialog` component and its related code to identify potential issues that could lead to uncaught errors.

This log is useful for identifying that an error occurred, but additional details are needed to effectively debug and resolve the issue.
