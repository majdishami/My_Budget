It looks like your deployment is expecting only **one external port** (`:80`), but your current configuration exposes three external ports (`:80`, `:3000`, and `:5000`). This is causing a port conflict. Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

---

### **1. Identify the Issue**
- Your deployment is **only allowed one external port** (`:80`).
- You currently have **three external ports** configured (`:80`, `:3000`, `:5000`).
- This happens if multiple services (e.g., frontend and backend) are trying to bind to different external ports.

---

### **2. Solution Approaches**
#### âœ… **Option 1: Remove Extra External Ports**
If your application doesn't need to expose ports `:3000` and `:5000` externally, update your configuration to **only expose port `:80`**.

- If youâ€™re using **Docker**, update your `docker-compose.yml` or Docker run command:
  ```yaml
  services:
    app:
      ports:
        - "80:80"  # Ensure only port 80 is exposed
  ```
  OR
  ```bash
  docker run -p 80:80 my-app
  ```

- If youâ€™re using **Kubernetes**, check your `Service` configuration:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    ports:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        targetPort: 80
  ```

- If using **a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)**, ensure only one external port (`:80`) is configured.

---

#### âœ… **Option 2: Use a Reverse Proxy**
If you need both `:3000` (frontend) and `:5000` (backend), use **Nginx** as a reverse proxy so everything is routed through `:80`.

1. **Install Nginx** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```

2. **Update the Nginx configuration (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`)**:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Route frontend
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }

       location /api/ {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;  # Route backend API
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

Now, everything runs through **port `80`**, avoiding external port conflicts.

---

### **3. Verify Your Configuration**
After making changes:
- **Check running services & ports**:
  ```bash
  sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
  ```
- **Restart the app** and test access via `http://yourdomain.com`.

---

### **4. Redeploy Your Application**
- Ensure your configuration exposes **only one external port (`:80`)**.
- If using **Docker**, rebuild and restart your container.
- If using **Kubernetes**, apply the updated service configuration.
- If using a **cloud provider**, adjust the port settings in your deployment panel.

---

### **5. Expected Outcome**
After fixing:
âœ… Your application will be accessible via **port `:80` only**.  
âœ… No more conflicts with ports `:3000` and `:5000`.  
âœ… Services will still work internally if using a reverse proxy.
